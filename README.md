They are 2 simple scripts in bash, which I used to study, their objective is simple, only one encodes any text string using hexadecimal/base64/Caesar Cipher/ which by default uses a 6-position exchange that is changed in the code of course, the second what it does is decrypt but using the tools in reverse of course, it is something very simple that I only used for my study

Steps to use the script:

1.Enter the text or output you want to encode:

Example

<img width="780" height="75" alt="s1" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3dc2fe4b-b9d1-4fcb-a337-9404465996f6" />



2.To decode it is exactly the same, you take the text that is encoded with this same format of course and:
